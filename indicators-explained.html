<p>The core RHoMIS survey contains over 750 variables.
These are used to calculate key indicators, such as
<code>total_income_lcu_per_year</code>.</p>
<p>This guide is designed to explain:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How each indicator is calculated</li>
<li>How variables are linked</li>
<li>How you can explore these calculations and indicators yourself</li>
</ol>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Main Principle in Calculations<a href="indicators-explained.html#main-principle-in-calculations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>RHoMIS is designed to collect information on wide range of
topics in a short amount of time. Questions in the survey
are asked in a way that we can make estimates, whilst not
forcing the respondent to provide a level of precision they
are not able to.</p>
<p>To calculate indicators such as income, productivity, gendered control of resources,
we rely on proportions and recall. This is best explained using worked examples (see below)</p>
<div id="worked-example" class="section level3 hasAnchor">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Worked Example<a href="indicators-explained.html#worked-example" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>When calculating crop productivity, respondents are asked to give the amount harvested over the past 12 months,
they are then asked to give the unit of this amount (e.g.Â âkgâ, âtonsâ, âgorogoroâ etc.).
By multiplying the two it is possible to calculate the number of kilograms harvested over
the past 12 months (letâs label this <span class="math inline">\(C_H\)</span>).</p>
<p>Respondents are also asked how much income they gain from the sale of this crop and the
units of this income (e.g.Â âtotal income per yearâ, âprice per kgâ, âprice per gorogoroâ etc.).
This can either be used to calculate total income per year or the income per kg
(letâs label these <span class="math inline">\(I_{yr}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I_{kg}\)</span> respectively).</p>
<p>Using these variables it is necessary to calculate: number of kg sold (<span class="math inline">\(C_s\)</span>),
number of kg consumed (<span class="math inline">\(C_c\)</span>), price per kilo (<span class="math inline">\(I_{kg}\)</span>), income per year (<span class="math inline">\(I_{yr}\)</span>),
value controlled by the man (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_M\)</span>), value controlled by the woman (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_W\)</span>) and the values of the crops which were consumed (<span class="math inline">\(V_{cons}\)</span>). These calculations mainly rely on proportion responses.
The respondent is asked what proportion of the harvest was consumed (<span class="math inline">\(prop_{cons}\)</span>) and what proportion was sold (<span class="math inline">\(prop_{sold}\)</span>), where none=0, little=0.1, under half=0.2, half=0.5, most=0.7, all=0.9. Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:cropconsume">\[\begin{equation}
    C_c = prop_{cons}C_H 
    \tag{4.1}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:cropsold">\[\begin{equation}
    C_s = prop_{sold}C_H
    \tag{4.2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Using the amount sold (<span class="math inline">\(C_S\)</span>) it is possible to work out income per kg and price per kilo (<span class="math inline">\(I_{kg}\)</span>) and income per year (<span class="math inline">\(I_{yr}\)</span>), depending on which sale units were given by the respondent:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:cropincomeperkg">\[\begin{equation}
    I_{kg} = \dfrac{P_{yr}}{C_s}
    \tag{4.3}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The price per kg is then averaged across the whole project and verified against FAOstat prices, or verified
by field staff. Please not this is step 2 of the indicator calculations. Price verification then
makes it possible to calculate the value of crop consumed (<span class="math inline">\(V_{cons}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:valueconsumed">\[\begin{equation}
    V_{cons} = P_{kg}{C_c}
    \tag{4.4}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, the value controlled by the female (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr{W}\)</span>) and the male (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_M\)</span>) in the household can be calculated. The respondent is asked what proportion of the crop consumed is controlled by the male (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_{Mcons}\)</span>) or the woman (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_{Wcons}\)</span>), where none=0, little=0.1, under half=0.2, half=0.5, most=0.7, all=0.9. The respondent is then asked what proportion of the income from the crop sale is controlled by the male (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_{IM}\)</span>) or the woman (<span class="math inline">\(Ctr_{IW}\)</span>). Which finally gives:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:controlmale">\[\begin{equation}
    Ctr_M= Ctr_{Mcons}V_{cons} + (Ctr_{IM}I_{yr})
    \tag{4.5}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:controlfemale">\[\begin{equation}
    Ctr_W= Ctr_{Wcons}V_{cons} + (Ctr_{IW}I_{yr})
    \tag{4.6}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>This style of proportion calculation is used throughout the indicator calculations,
for further details please see individual explanations of each indicator (below).</strong></p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Indicators<a href="indicators-explained.html#indicators-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of indicators generated in the RHoMIS dataset. In the final âindicatorâ table,
we have a few key indicators, such as total income, household size, and total land cultivated.
For complex indicators, such as total income, we have to calculate a series of intermediate indicators
to reach the final income (e.g.Â crop harvested, amount sold, income per kg for that crop). The table
below summarises all of the indicators (and intermediate indicators), calculated for core RHoMIS
outputs.</p>
<p>In this table you will find:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indicator Name</strong>: The name of the indicator</li>
<li><strong>Output Format</strong>: The format for the outputted indicator. If âcolumnâ, then the indicator will be found as a column in the final indicator table. If âloopâ, the indicator will be found across multiple columns in the processed dataset (e.g âcrop_name_1â, âcrop_name_2â, âcrop_name_3ââ¦).</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: A description of the indicators required</li>
<li><strong>Individual Columns Required</strong>: Which individual columns in the processed data are needed to calculate the indicator (e.g.Â for land_cultivated_ha, we rely on the columns âlandcultivatedâ and âunitlandâ)</li>
<li><strong>Loop Columns Required</strong>: Which âloopedâ columns are needed to calculate the indicator (e.g.Â for âcrop_harvest_kg_per_year_1â, âcrop_harvest_kg_per_year_2ââ¦ we need the columns âcrop_yield_1â âcrop_yield_2â, âcrop_yield_3ââ¦ and âcrop_yield_units_1â, âcrop_yield_units_2â, âcrop_yield_units_3ââ¦)</li>
<li><strong>Conversion Tables Required</strong>: Many indicators rely on conversion tables. For example âcrop_yield_unitsâ come as strings (e.g.Â âsacks_50kgâ, âcartsâ). Conversion tables are used to switch between strings and numeric conversion factors. In this column we specify which conversion factors are required.</li>
<li><strong>API Data Required</strong>: Some indicators rely on external APIs, for example to obtain currency conversions. This column specifies which API data is needed.</li>
<li><strong>Indicators Required</strong>: Some indicators rely on other intermediate indicators. For example, total income relies on crop income, livestock income, and off-farm income. Here we specify which indicators an indicator depends on.</li>
<li><strong>Function Calculated</strong>: Which function in the RHoMIS R-package is used to calculate the indicator</li>
<li><strong>Search Term</strong>: A unique search term which can be used to identify the point where the indicator is calculated within the function.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency Diagram</strong>: A link to a diagram which illustrates how the indicator is connected to other indicators/columns.</li>
</ul>
