# Indicators Explained

The core RHoMIS survey contains over 750 variables.
These are used to calculate key indicators, such as 
`total_income_lcu_per_year`. 

This guide is designed to explain:

1. How some of the main indicators are calculated
2. How variables are linked
3. How you can explore these calculations and indicators yourself

In order to make the most of this guide, you should have a sample RHoMIS 
dataset, to see how to process a "Raw" RHoMIS dataset, and produce indicators
from this dataset, please see [data processing][Data Processing]

## Where to start

Firstly,

```{r}

plot_dependency_network(
    indicator_name="crop_sold_kg_per_year",
    indicator_list=indicator_list
)


```
