# About

The Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) is designed to collect data on smallholder farmers.
The survey is rich in information, covering a range of topics from dietary diversity to livelihoods.
With so much information available, it can often be difficult to extract, 
This is a book documenting how to use the RHoMIS R-package. We cover
3 main topics: 

1. How to process data collected RHoMIS
2. The logic of the calculations, and an overview of key indicators/outputs
2. How to use the R-package to extract useful information
