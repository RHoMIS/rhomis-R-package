# About

The Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) is designed to collect data on smallholder farmers.
The survey is rich in information, covering a range of topics from dietary diversity to livelihoods.
With so much information available, it can often be difficult to extract, 
This is a book documentating how to use the RHoMIS R-package to process
data collected with the Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey.

## Key Concepts

Data processing occurs in three main steps:

1. Verification of units
2. Verification of prices and calorie conversions
3. Calculation of final indicators
