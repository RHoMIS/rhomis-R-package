# Installation

Currently RHoMIS is not available on CRAN, but 
we hope one day it will be. In the meantime, to 
install the RHoMIS R-package, you will need to install `devtools`,
you can that by entering the following into the R console:


```r
install.packages("devtools")
```


Then to install the most recent version of the R-package you can enter 
the following command


```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/l-gorman/rhomis-R-package", force = TRUE)
```
